## 📌 Business Problem & Project Scenario  

The business team requested a dashboard solution to:  
- Provide insights into **sales, customers, and products**.  
- Answer **key business questions** through SQL analysis.  
- Present findings in an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to support decision-making on sales growth, customer retention, and product performance.  

This project simulates a **real-world business environment**, where raw e-commerce data is transformed, modeled, and visualized for strategic use.  

---

## 📋 Business Questions Addressed  

✔️ Retrieve the total sales for each product category.  
✔️ Identify customers who made purchases in the last month.  
✔️ Calculate the average order value.  
✔️ Track monthly & weekly sales trends.  
✔️ Measure customer retention & churn.  
✔️ Identify top-selling products & categories.  
✔️ Segment customers using **RFM analysis**.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies  

**Data Sources**  
- `Categories.csv`, `Customers.csv`, `Geolocation.csv`, `Order Items.csv`,  
- `Order Payments.csv`, `Orders.csv`, `Products.csv`, `Reviews.csv`,  
- `Segment.csv`, `Sellers.csv`, `StatesName.csv`.  

**Tech Stack**  
- **Database & Data Modeling:** PostgreSQL (Views, Materialized Views)  
- **Data Exploration:** DBeaver  
- **Data Visualization:** Power BI  
- **UI/UX Wireframing:** Figma  
- **Documentation & Reporting:** PDF

## 🗄️ Data Model  

The dataset was originally provided as multiple raw CSVs.  
To optimize for analytics, the data was remodeled into a **Star Schema** using SQL Views & Materialized Views.  

### 🔹 Fact Table  
- **Fact_Sales** → Stores all transactional data (sales amount, quantity, order details).  

### 🔹 Dimension Tables  
- **Dim_Customers** → Customer details (demographics, location).  
- **Dim_Sellers** → Seller information.  
- **Dim_Product** → Product attributes (category, subcategory, price).  
- **Dim_Payment** → Payment details (method, installments, amounts).  
- **Review** → Aggregated table with average review score per order.  

### 🔹 Extra Tables for Advanced Analysis  
- **RFM Table** → Customer segmentation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) created in Power BI with DAX.  
- **Order_Bridge_Table** → Resolves many-to-many relationships between orders and other entities.  
- **Calendar Table** → Custom Date table for advanced time intelligence (MoM, YoY, rolling averages).  

✅ Schema benefits:  
- Efficient querying and scalability.  
- Cleaner relationships for BI reporting.  
- Support for advanced analytics (RFM, retention, churn).

## 📂 Data Workflow  

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Transformation  
- Joined and cleaned raw data in **PostgreSQL**.  
- Created **Materialized Views** for fact tables.  
- Created **Normal Views** for dimension tables.  
- Added **Calendar Table** for time intelligence.  

### 2️⃣ Data Modeling  
- Star Schema design (Fact & Dim views).  
- Bridge table for complex relationships.  
- RFM segmentation table for customer insights.  

### 3️⃣ Visualization in Power BI  
- Built a **3-page interactive dashboard** with KPIs, trends, comparisons, and filter panels.
